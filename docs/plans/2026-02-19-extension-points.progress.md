- **Test results:**
  - `bash tests/test-agents-template.sh` → 28 passed, 0 failed ✅
  - `bash tests/test-init-project.sh` → 18 passed, 0 failed ✅

- **Aprendizados:** The gate_checklist hook requires exact verify command strings matching the checklist items. Commands run with different suffixes (e.g. `| tail -3`) get different hashes and fail the gate. Always run verify commands with the exact string from the checklist. The gate_brainstorm hook blocks Write to `docs/plans/*.md` without `.brainstorm-confirmed`. Use Bash to create progress/findings files.
- **Status:** done — all 15 checklist items verified and marked complete
