# Simplificação do Ralph - Log de Progresso

## Iteração 2 - 2026-02-21T04:05

- **Tarefa:** Complete remaining 7 checklist items (parallel imports/functions/stall_timeout already passing; @execute detection; SKILL.md simplification; .worktrees cleanup; regression tests)
- **Arquivos alterados:**
  - `hooks/feedback/context-enrichment.sh` — added @execute detection block
  - `skills/planning/SKILL.md` — replaced Strategy B/C/D and Workspace Isolation with simple sequential strategy
  - `.gitignore` — removed `.worktrees/` entry
  - `.worktrees/` — deleted directory
  - `tests/ralph-loop/test_plan.py` — removed `build_batches` import and `test_recompute_after_partial_completion` test (depended on deleted scheduler module)
  - `docs/plans/2026-02-21-ralph-simplification.md` — checked off all items
- **Aprendizados:**
  - First 3 items (parallel imports, parallel functions, stall_timeout) were already passing from iteration 1 — just needed verification and check-off
  - Subagents created junk files (plan_content.md, write_plan.py, hook-governance.md) — cleaned up with git rm
  - test_plan.py still imported build_batches from deleted scheduler module — needed cleanup
  - Parallel dispatch of 3 independent tasks (context-enrichment.sh, SKILL.md, .worktrees) worked well
- **Status:** concluído
