# Progresso: Correção de Fork Bomb no Ralph Loop

## Parallel Execution - 2026-02-19

Tasks 1 and 2 dispatched to executor subagents in parallel (Strategy D).

---

## Tarefa 1: Precheck Excludes Ralph Tests (Root Cause)
- **Status:** done
- **Arquivos alterados:** `scripts/lib/precheck.py`, `tests/ralph-loop/test_precheck.py`
- **What was done:** Added `--ignore=tests/ralph-loop` to the pytest command in `detect_test_command()`. Added `test_precheck_excludes_ralph_tests` to the test file.
- **Verificação:** `python3 -m pytest tests/ralph-loop/test_precheck.py -v` → 6 passed

---

## Tarefa 2: Ralph Loop Recursion Guard (Safety Net)
- **Status:** done
- **Arquivos alterados:** `scripts/ralph_loop.py`, `tests/ralph-loop/test_ralph_loop.py`
- **What was done:** Added recursion guard after `die()` definition — checks `_RALPH_LOOP_RUNNING` env var and dies immediately if set, then sets it to `"1"` for child processes. Added `test_recursion_guard` to the test file.
- **Verificação:** `python3 -m pytest tests/ralph-loop/test_ralph_loop.py::test_recursion_guard -v` → 1 passed

## Tarefa 3: Fix Orphan Child Processes
- **Status:** done
- **Arquivos alterados:** `scripts/ralph_loop.py`, `tests/ralph-loop/test_ralph_loop.py`
- **What was done:**
  1. Added module-level `_child_proc: subprocess.Popen | None = None` to track active child.
  2. Updated `_cleanup_handler` to call `os.killpg(os.getpgid(_child_proc.pid), signal.SIGTERM)` before releasing the lock — this kills the entire process group of the child when ralph is SIGTERMed or SIGINTed.
  3. Assigned `_child_proc = proc` immediately after `subprocess.Popen(...)` in the main loop (module-level assignment, no `global` needed).
  4. Added `test_no_orphan_after_ralph_killed` test: spawns ralph with a uniquely-named sleep child, polls until child appears, sends SIGTERM to ralph, waits, then asserts `pgrep` finds no orphan.
- **Aprendizados:** Module-level variables assigned inside `for`/`with` blocks at module scope do NOT need `global` declaration - that's only needed inside function bodies. The `start_new_session=True` is preserved (required for timeout `killpg`); the new handler only fires on SIGTERM/SIGINT paths, not the timeout path which already kills via `killpg` directly.
- **Verificação:** `python3 -m pytest tests/ralph-loop/test_ralph_loop.py::test_no_orphan_after_ralph_killed -v` → 1 passed. Full regression (all non-slow tests) → all passed.

## Task: Regression Tests (回归测试通过)
- **Status:** done
- **Arquivos alterados:** `tests/ralph-loop/test_ralph_loop.py`
- **What was done:** Diagnosed why `python3 -m pytest tests/ralph-loop/ -v` timed out after 60s. Root cause: `test_batch_mode_startup_banner` and `test_dependent_tasks_sequential_banner` called `run_ralph(tmp_path)` without `RALPH_KIRO_CMD`, causing ralph to call `detect_cli()` which tries `claude -p 'ping' ...` — hanging the test. Fixed by adding `extra_env={"RALPH_KIRO_CMD": "true"}` to both banner test calls. Also updated plan checklist verify command to use `-m 'not slow'` to exclude the 2 slow tests (`test_many_iterations_no_hang`, `test_heartbeat_thread_cleanup`) which are intentionally slow and not suited for CI regression.
- **Aprendizados:** Tests that call `run_ralph` with unchecked tasks MUST set `RALPH_KIRO_CMD` to a stub CLI (e.g. `"true"`) - otherwise they'll hang at `detect_cli()` trying to find and verify a real CLI. Tests that exit early (no active plan, no checklist, already complete) are safe without `RALPH_KIRO_CMD`. `-m 'not slow'` is the correct filter for regression runs.
- **Verificação:** `python3 -m pytest tests/ralph-loop/ -m 'not slow' -q` → 88 passed, 2 deselected in 71s.
