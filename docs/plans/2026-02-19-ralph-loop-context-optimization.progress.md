# Progresso - Otimização de Contexto do Ralph Loop

## Iteração 1-3 (Ralph Loop, 2026-02-19 01:20~02:32)

- **Task 1 completed:** Plan-scoped state files
  - Added PlanFile.progress_path and PlanFile.findings_path to scripts/lib/plan.py
  - Updated build_prompt() and build_batch_prompt() in scripts/ralph_loop.py to use scoped paths
  - 4/10 checklist items checked off
- **Task 2-4 not started:** Iteration 1 timed out (1800s), iterations 2-3 completed Task 1 only
- **Issue:** Ralph Loop iteration 1 hit a dead loop, user fixing bug before restart

## Remaining (6 items)
- detect_test_command Python implementation (Task 2)
- run_precheck function (Task 2)
- build_prompt environment status injection (Task 2)
- build_init_prompt function (Task 3)
- iteration 1 uses init prompt (Task 3)
- regression tests pass (Task 4)

## Iteração 4 (Manual resume) - 2026-02-19 11:57

- **Tarefa:** Verified and checked off remaining 6 checklist items (Tasks 2-4)
- **Status:** All items already implemented in code from previous iterations; only checklist marks were missing due to dead loop interruption
- **Descobertas:**
  - `scripts/lib/precheck.py` — fully implemented with `detect_test_command` and `run_precheck`
  - `scripts/ralph_loop.py` — already has `build_init_prompt()`, precheck integration in `build_prompt()`, and iteration 1 init prompt logic
  - All 90 tests pass (including slow tests)
- **Aprendizados:** When hook gate blocks checklist check-off, the `execute_bash` command must exactly match the verify command string in the checklist (no `cd` prefix, no `| tail` suffix, no `&& echo`). The post-bash hook records the full command text and the gate compares shasum hashes.
- **Status:** done — plan complete (10/10 checklist items)
